    <h2>A satisfying and simple dish</h2>
        <p>Spam musubi is a popular snack in Hawaii. It is a type of sushi that features marinated cooked Spam.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups uncooked short grain white rice </li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
            <li> 1 (12 ounce) container fully cooked luncheon meat (such as Spam)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>5 sheets sushi nori (dry seaweed)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak uncooked rice in water to cover for 4 hours; drain and rinse.</li>
            <li>Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pan from heat and stir in rice vinegar. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Stir together sugar, soy sauce, and oyster sauce in a medium bowl until sugar is completely dissolved. Slice luncheon meat lengthwise into 10 slices, or to desired thickness, and marinate in sauce for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook slices until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Cut nori sheets in half and lay on a flat work surface. Place a rice press in the center of a sheet, and press rice tightly inside. Top with a slice of luncheon meat, and remove press. Wrap nori around rice, sealing edges with a small amount of water. (Rice may also be formed by hand in the shape of the meat slices and about 1-inch thick.)</li>
            <li>Serve musubi warm or chilled.</li>
        </ol>
