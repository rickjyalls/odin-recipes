    <h2>A simple and delicious dish</h2>
        <p>This is super simple, and even hard-core Texan meat eaters who have never eaten a vegetable in their lives like it. You can substitute yogurt for the sour cream if you want a lighter version.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup light sour cream</li>
            <li>1 can green salsa 7oz</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh spinach, rinsed and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 Cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>1 package corn tortillas 10oz</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175degrees C).</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together half of the sour cream and the green salsa. Spread enough to coat the bottom into a 9x13 inch baking dish. On each tortilla, spread a small amount of the salsa and sour cream in the center. Lay a small handful of spinach over that, and sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese. Roll up, secure with a toothpick and place into the baking dish. When all of the tortillas are in the pan, pour the remaining salsa over the top and sprinkle with the remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until the enchiladas are browned and heated through.</li>
        </ol>
